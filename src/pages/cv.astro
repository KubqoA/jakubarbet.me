        I helped building one of the first decentralized exchanges on top of Cardano blockchain. My responsibility was
        the architecture of the off-chain components of the smart contracts, and providing domain knowledge to help make
        technological and business decisions.

        Rychlotest Covid, covid testing with good UX, was the first product I worked on. I helped modernize the UI, and
        I introduced granular permission system to the application. The second project was Cardano application for the
        Ledger hardware wallet, written in embedded C. This project helped me understand blockchains in general and the
        ins and outs of Cardano.

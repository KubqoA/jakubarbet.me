        Rychlotest Covid, covid testing with good UX, was the first product I worked on. I helped
        modernize the UI, and I introduced granular permission system to the application. The second
        project was Cardano application for the Ledger hardware wallet, written in embedded C. This
        project helped me understand blockchains in general and the ins and outs of Cardano.
